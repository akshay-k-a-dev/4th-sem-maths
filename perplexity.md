## 🎯 1. The Exam Game Plan

The exam gives you lots of choices. You don't need to know everything to get full marks!

* 
**Total Marks:** 60.


* **Section A (Short Answers):** 2 Marks each. Maximum you can score is 20 . (Aim to answer 10-12 questions).


* **Section B (Medium Problems):** 5 Marks each. Maximum you can score is 30 . (Aim to answer 6-7 questions).


* **Section C (Essay/Long Problems):** 10 Marks. Answer just **ONE** question out of two .



**Your Strategy:** Target the 10-mark **Laplace Initial Value Problem** in Section C first, then hunt for **Linear** and **Exact** differential equations in Sections A and B.

## 🌊 4. Module IV: Fourier Series & PDEs (Breaking the Wave)

### The Ultimate Shortcut: Even vs. Odd

Before calculating a Fourier Series, look at the graph of the function .

* **Is it Odd?** (Like , , ). If you plug in , the sign flips.
* *Shortcut:*  and . You ONLY have to calculate !


* **Is it Even?** (Like , , ). If you plug in , it stays exactly the same.
* *Shortcut:* . You ONLY have to calculate  and !



### Essay Masterclass: Full Fourier Series (10 Marks)

**Pattern:** "Expand  in a Fourier series".

**Step-by-Step Recipe:**

1. **Check Parity:** . It is **Even**. This means .
2. **Calculate  (The Average):**


3. **Calculate :**



*(Use Integration by Parts shortcut: )*.
* 
* 
Multiply them down the line and plug in the limits ( to ). Remember .


4. **Write Final Answer:**



### Problem Type D: Classifying PDEs (2 Marks)

**Pattern:** "Show that  is parabolic" .

**Step-by-Step Recipe:**
Think of the quadratic formula discriminant: .

1. **Find A, B, C:**
*  = number next to  (Here, A=1).
*  = number next to  (Here, B=6).
*  = number next to  (Here, C=9).


2. **Calculate:** .
3. **The Rule:**
* If  Hyperbolic
* If  Parabolic
* If  Elliptic
* **Answer:** Since it equals 0, it is Parabolic!

## ⏱️ 5. Final Time Management & Scoring Advice

* **Step Marks are Everything:** Math exams give points for knowing the formula. Even if you can't integrate  in a Fourier series, write down the formula for it. That's a free mark.
* **Tackle the Big Fish First:** Do the 10-mark Laplace problem while your brain is fresh. A small plus/minus error at the end ruins the whole page.
* **Play the Ceiling System:** In Section A, you only need 10 correct answers to get the maximum 20 marks. Don't waste time doing all 12 questions perfectly if you already nailed the first 10.
